1. Tools
   For front-end development we use Gulp and some other tools. To run Gulp we need to setup NodeJS(https://nodejs.org).
   Go to root project folder. To automatically install required packages run:

	 > npm install

   To install packages in 'manual mode' use the list of packages from package.json file. Command below will install
   packages globally so we could use their in CLI mode.

	 > npm install -g <package name>

2. A package manager for the web(http://bower.io)
   Run command:

	 > npm install -g bower

   > *Note!* On Windows platform add a path %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\ into PATH variable.

3. Install other packages. Requirements listed in bower.json

	 > bower install

  Create an empty file at "misc/gulp/config.js" and copy content from "misc/gulp/config-GULP_EXAMPLE.js" into newly created.
  In config change "_localDomain" variable value on which you use in main config.

Gulp-commands(command names correspond to the file names in "gulp/tasks/" folder)

  > gulp build - full rebuild
  > gulp       - by default do build, run tracking for changes in files to update webpage in realtime which will be
  >              opened in browser listed in "gulp/config.js".
