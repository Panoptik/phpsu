1- What is this?
   * This is development version of php.su site
   * Official site http://php.su

2- Requirements
   * PHP 5.3.3 or greater with installed GMP module(see http://php.net/manual/en/gmp.setup.php)
   * MySQL 4.1 or greater, and either MySQLi or PDO library must be enabled

3- How to install
   a) At first step you should create a new database and import SQL dump from "misc/phpsu.sql" into you database.
   b) On second step configure you virtual hosts in Apache config

      <VirtualHost *:80>
              ServerName domain
              DocumentRoot /path/do/project_name/public_html
              ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
              LogLevel debug
              CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
      </VirtualHost>

      <VirtualHost *:80>
              ServerName stN.domain
              DocumentRoot /path/do/project_name/static_html
      </VirtualHost>

      <VirtualHost *:80>
              ServerName fsN.domain
              DocumentRoot /path/do/project_name/uploads_html
      </VirtualHost>

   c) Add hosts into "/etc/hosts" ("%WINDIR%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" on Windows platform)

      127.0.0.1 domain
      127.0.0.1 stN.domain
      127.0.0.1 fsN.domain

      Descriptions of folders and hosts:
         * application  - application directory
         * public_html  - main domain directory: http://domain/
         * static_html  - static data (images, styles, scripts, etc.) subdomain directory: http://stN.domain/
         * uploads_html - directory of uploaded items: http://fsN.domain/

   d) Last step is to create a configuration files:
         * Create an empty file at "application/config/main.json" and copy content from "misc/main-EXAMPLE.json" into newly created.
         * Create an empty file at "application/config/hosts.json" and copy content from "misc/hosts-EXAMPLE.json" into newly created.
         * Customize parameters in these files according to you settings.

4- Front-end development
   +  gulp/               - The streaming builder
   +      config.js       - Builder config
   +      tasks/          - Builder tasks
   +  source/             - The source files of static content
   +      css/            - Sass files
   +      js/             - Scripts
   +      images/         - Images(not a content images)
   +      fonts/          - Fonts
   +  node_modules/       - Tools for development (folder in .gitignore)
   +  bower_components/   - Bower components (folder in .gitignore)
   *  static_html/        - Static content. Content of this folder automatically generated by the builder.
                            Do not write any files into this folder, add files into source folder.
   a) Tools
       For front-end development we use Gulp and some other tools. To run Gulp we need to setup NodeJS(https://nodejs.org).
       Go to root project folder. To automatically install required packages run:

         npm install

       To install packages in 'manual mode' use the list of packages from package.json file. Command below will install
       packages globally so we could use their in CLI mode.

         npm install -g <package name>

   b) A package manager for the web(http://bower.io)
       Run command:

         npm install -g bower

       Note! On Windows platform add a path %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\ into PATH variable.

   c) Install other packages. Requirements listed on bower.json

         bower install

      Create an empty file at "misc/gulp/config.js" and copy content from "misc/gulp/config-GULP_EXAMPLE.js" into newly created.
      In config change "_localDomain" variable value on which you use in main config.

   Gulp-commands(command names correspond to the file names in "gulp/tasks/" folder)

      gulp build - full rebuild
      gulp       - by default do build, run tracking for changes in files to update webpage in realtime which will be
                   opened in browser listed in "gulp/config.js".
